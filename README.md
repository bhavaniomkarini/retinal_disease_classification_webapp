# retinal_disease_classification_webapp
This is my project where I've developed a web application for my deep learning model using Gradio. The deep learning model is based on a customized 19-layer deep Convolutional Neural Network, the VGG-19 architecture. It classifies the OCT images that we supply into four categories: NORMAL, CNV, DME, and DRUSEN.
